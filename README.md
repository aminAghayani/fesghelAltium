This is our drones board designed by Altium Designer.
The responsibility of this board was to connect several sensors to an stm32f4 and a minipc. These modules helped creating control loop system and enabled drone to keep its balance.
Also, using the minipc, the drone was able to analyze the cameras feed and decide where to go.
This board also acted as our drones body and we attached the carbon arms directly to it.
